# agile_web_frontend

In order to run the frontend,use the following steps:

1. Run the command 'npm install' within the terminal in order to install the packages specified in the 'package json'. This will create a package-lock.json file and a
'node_modules' folder.

3. Once the previous steps are successful, the command 'npm start' can be used to start the frontend.

## Pre Requisites

* Running MYSQL database using XAMPP
(start apache also if you want to edit database manually.)
