# agile_web_backend

In order to run the backend,use the following steps:

1. copy the 'template.env' file in the root of the project and rename to '.env'.
   In this, fill in the fields with the relevant details.

2. Then run the command 'npm install' within the terminal in order to install the packages specified in the 'package.json'.
   This will create a package-lock.json file and a 'node_modules' folder.

3. Once the previous steps are successful, the command 'npm start' can be used to start the backend.
